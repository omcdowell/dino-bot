# Changelog

## v0.1.4

- **Shared Mac, own tailnet.** Each macOS account can run its own userspace `tailscaled` and point
  setup at it, so two people on one Mac each keep their own tailnet (README, "Second person
  on the same Mac").
- **`PASEO_TRUST_LOOPBACK`.** With a userspace `tailscaled` DinoBot listens on `127.0.0.1`, so the
  installer sets `PASEO_TRUST_LOOPBACK=false` there: other accounts on the same computer must pair
  like any other device. Default (unset or `true`) keeps the old behaviour.
- **Install URL.** `curl -fsSL https://omcdowell.github.io/dino-bot/install | sh` now serves the
  installer script (it fetches the latest release's signed `install.sh`) instead of an HTML page.
- Builds from this repo's in-tree folders (`paseo/`, `plugins/bots/`, `optchat/`,
  `addons/paseo-apns/`).

## v0.1.3

- First public release.
